## Professional Summary
I am a professional support consultant, forged in the golden era of Sybase. Over 30 years of hands-on experience in enterprise support, administration, and technical project management.

This public GitHub project is dedicated to exploring SAP's preemptive support, focusing on __proactive__ issue resolution rather than __reactive support__. It aims to identify and address potential problems before they impact business operations, leveraging technologies like [__AI and machine learning__](https://github.com/andreshermoso/sap/blob/main/AI/AIA/Readme.md) to predict and prevent issues. This approach is crucial for maintaining smooth operations, especially during peak times like a <i>Black Friday</i> or a <i>Cyber Monday</i>.

#### Intelligent Operations Maintenance. AI-Powered, Skill-Based Incident Routing.
When routing incidents to the next available specialist and moving beyond simple availability-based routing, a __SAP intelligent__ system leverages __AI__ to triage and assign incidents based on deep qualification matching. This ensures every inquiry is handled by the __best-suited specialist__

- Key __Matching Criteria__ Include <br> <br>
   - Specific technical skills and knowledge
   - Historical resolution success rates <br> <br>
