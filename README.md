This public GitHub project is dedicated to exploring SAP's preemptive support, focusing on __proactive__ issue resolution rather than __reactive support__. It aims to identify and address potential problems before they impact business operations, leveraging technologies like [__AI and machine learning__](https://github.com/andreshermoso/sap/blob/main/AI/AIA/Readme.md) to predict and prevent issues. This approach is crucial for maintaining smooth operations, especially during peak times like a <i>Black Friday</i> or a <i>Cyber Monday</i>.
