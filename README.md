I am a professional support consultant, forged in the golden era of Sybase. <br>
A senior IT consultant with over 30 years of hands-on experience in enterprise support, administration, and technical project management.


This public GitHub project is dedicated to exploring how Artificial Intelligence (AI) Agents can transform SAP Application Service Management (ASM) by shifting from a __reactive__ to a __proactive__ and autonomous support model. The goal is to accelerate learning, drive continuous improvement, and focus on truly complex and strategic challenges, such as:  
- automating routine tasks
- providing real time insights
- resolving issues without human intervention

Unlike traditional scripts or chatbots, AI Agents possess contextual understanding, can plan and execute actions, and leverage multiple tools to achieve results. This agentic capability makes them uniquely suited to address the multifaceted challenges of SAP support.

#### Key AI-Driven Capabilities for SAP ASM

1. __Proactive Issue Resolution__ : AI Agents can continuously monitor the SAP landscape, analyzing system logs, performance metrics, and user-reported data to predict and prevent issues before they escalate. For example, an agent could detect a slow-running batch job, identify the root cause (e.g., a database lock), and either resolve it automatically or alert the right team with a detailed analysis.
2. __Automated Root Cause Analysis (RCA)__ : When issues occur, AI Agents can quickly perform RCA by correlating events across SAP modules and integrated systems. They pinpoint the exact source of the problem and generate detailed reports, reducing resolution time and improving accuracy.
3. __Improved Service Quality and Uptime__ : By automating maintenance tasks, monitoring system health, and responding instantly to failures, AI Agents maintain high service quality and improve uptime, resulting in a more stable and reliable SAP environment.
4. __Enhanced Resource Management__ : AI Agents can optimize infrastructure usage by monitoring patterns, suggesting adjustments, or automatically scaling resources to meet demand—ensuring efficiency while managing costs.
5. __Customer-Centric Proactive Upselling__ : By analyzing customer usage data, business processes, and support tickets, AI Agents can identify gaps and opportunities, proactively recommending relevant SAP products or services tailored to the customer’s needs—effectively automating the upsell process.



#### SAP ASE Production Recovery Scenario

I recently installed the latest version of SAP ASE on several operating systems. Based on my extensive technical background with SAP ASE, I know that one of the most common—and challenging—production outage scenarios occurs when database core data files are moved from one storage location to another at the operating system level while the engine is running.

This is a classic yet critical database administration mistake, often seen when attempting to address storage space exhaustion. As of 2025, many financial institutions in Latin America still run their core banking systems on SAP ASE, making such incidents high-risk.

I have simulated this failure scenario and successfully resolved it. Recovering from this type of issue requires precise, methodical action to avoid the risk of losing production data. Despite decades of technological advancement, the fundamental recovery process remains the same.

While it is theoretically possible to script and automate the recovery procedure, the complexity of real-time, high-transaction, large-volume financial systems makes such automation risky. An inexperienced DBA would likely hesitate to rely on a primitive recovery script in a live crisis. Even seasoned professionals would prefer reliable, tested, and supported AI-driven tools to accelerate recovery, ensuring safe and efficient management of large-scale corporate ecosystems.
